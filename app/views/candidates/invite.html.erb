        <p><strong>Body:</strong><br>
        Hi Sarah,</p>

        <p>You've been recommended for Hired by your friend John Kueh (yoongfook@gmail.com). Hired is the new way to discover full-time job opportunities where companies submit job offers & salary details upfront - BEFORE you interview. Hired currently works with 600 companies - including the likes of Twitter, AirBnB and Jawbone.</p>

        "This is the best source I've found for picking up solid job leads. Lots of startups, but also more serious employers that aren't just running a business because that's the cool thing to do these days."</p>

        <p>Since you've been recommended, you get a special perk: priority review of your profile and higher likelihood of invitation into an auction.</p>

        <p>Join Hired through your personal link:<br> 
        http://hired.com/invited/sarah@accruto.com</p>

        <p>Few things you should know about Hired:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The "auctions" run for one week and are curated on both sides, so you'll only be approached by hiring managers at pre-vetted venture-funded companies. No 3rd party recruiters allowed!</li>
          <li>Your profile will never be publicly visible. It can only be viewed by approved employers during an auction after you opt-in to that specific auction. </li>
          <li>It's free for you to use. Even more so, we'll share our fee with you if you take a job through the site: that means an additional $3000-$6000 as soon as you accept an offer! </li>
          <li>Our vision is to eliminate slimy recruiters and put YOU in control of your career.</li>
        </ul>
